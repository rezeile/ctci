The following file exercise problmes from Steven and Felix Halim's 
competitive programming 3. These exercises are intended to test 
the programmer's facility with some well known programming 
languages. I have attempted these exercises in C, C++, and Java since
I will be using these three languages in my coding exercises as well
as competitive programming questions.

1. Using Java, read in a double, echo it, but with a minimum field 
   width of 7 and 3 digits after the decimal point.

2. Given an integer n "n leq 15" print pi to n digits after the
   decimal point (rounded).

3. Given a date, determine the day of the week on that day.

4. Given n random integers, print the distinct integers in sorted order
